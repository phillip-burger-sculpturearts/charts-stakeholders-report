<h1>README</h1>

<p>This text accompanies the charts for the FY2013 stakeholders report. The intended audience for this README file is the business group that owns the data and is responsible for preparing the report, and the web programmers responsible for preparing and publishing the report. </p>

<h2>Intended use</h2>

<p>The files are intended for use in an iframe tag that references the directory that the files are saved in. This use provides lower turn around time for edits and updates that need to be performed to the charts. A corrected file with the same file name can be moved into the folder and displayed on the next page view.</p>

<p>To ensure that returning customers are able to view the chart, the customer should do a hard refresh that bypasses their local cache. On Windows, a hard refresh of a web page is done via the key sequence CTRL-SHIFT and R. </p>

<h2>File naming convention</h2>

<p>The files are named for the tab, or business domain, that they refer to, abbreviated to three characters. The next the three characters indicate that it&#39;s for a tab on the stakeholders report. The numerical sequence is next, and goes from 1 to 99. This number indicates the sequence of the chart within the tab as published on the Web page.</p>

<p>For example, fintab8.html indicates that it&#39;s the eight chart in the financial tab and that it&#39;s variation be of the eighth chart. The tabs are identified as follows:</p>

<p><strong>fin</strong> - financial<br/>
<strong>ear</strong> - education and research<br/>
<strong>com</strong> - community  </p>

<h2>Future stakeholder reports</h2>

<p>To be able to reproduce the same charts in future years, but with updated content, the data and code used to produce the charts will be made freely available on Github under the user will be posted on Github and made freely available via either a gist or repository under user <code>sculpturearts</code>.</p>
